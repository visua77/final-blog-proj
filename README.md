# Technigo bootcamp final project

Description: A blog-application made with react on the frontend and express and
mongoDB for the backend.

Most proud of: To have made a fullstack-application with my own backend.

Struggles: How to make the comments "stick" to the right post.

Left to-do: 
-Make endpoints for "tags" like restaurants/accomodation
-Add auth for admins so they can log in and write new posts(the ui for posting to the DB is already up and running).
-Build a hamburger-menu on mobile-devices
-Put some more love into the photo-album
